# ಠ_ಠ.js

Replaces `console.warn` with less-vague name to clearly indicate looking at something with a judgemental face.

```html
<script src="ಠ_ಠ.js"></script>
<script>
  var user = "Tim";
  ಠ_ಠ(user);
  // Logs "Tim" to console as a warning.
</script>
```

## Browser Compatibility

Should be good for [any modern browser](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console.warn): Chrome/Opera/Safari edge, Firefox 4.0+ and Internet Explorer 8+.

## License

Idk, MIT, I guess.
